# Animal Crossing Amazon In Stock Monitor

### Introduction
* A small scraper I wrote to scrape Amazon for in stock alert on Amazon.

### How-To
* Set up a jupyter environment and run the `main.ipynb`.
* Once you run the `main()` program in the end, the computer will scrape the amazon page randomly every 0-30 seconds.

### Features
* It utilizes a difference between buttons for "Buy Now" and "Other Shipping Options" to distinguish the state of stock.
* It fakes itself into an iOS device to bypass some of the anti-scraping features.
* It will pop up a new window once it find out that the item is in stock.
* It also has a mailman feature which will send emails to all the email addresses in the mailing list.
* It will also save a page of the most recent scraped HTML for debug useages.

### Conclusion
* May the god of Tom Nook bless all of us with a cute switch :P
